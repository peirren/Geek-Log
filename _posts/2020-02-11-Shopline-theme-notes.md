### [Theme templates](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/development/templates)
Shopify themes are made up of Liquid template files, each serving their own unique purpose. For example, collection.liquid is used to display multiple products, and product.liquid is used to show the details of a single product. Shopify themes also include a settings_schema.json file, which is a form that makes it easy for the user to customize the look-and-feel of the theme.

### Theme structure
A Shopify theme includes the following directories:

- assets
- config
- layout
- locales
- ections
- nippets
- emplates
